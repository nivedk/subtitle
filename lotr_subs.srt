2
00:00:08,393 --> 00:01:26,260
I know what it is you saw.

3
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:31,156
For it is also in my mind.

4
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:36,963
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

5
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:44,245
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

6
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:48,181
He will try to take the Ring.

7
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:49,345
You know of whom I speak.

8
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:56,033
One by one, it will destroy them all.

9
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,976
If you ask it of me...

10
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:03,438
...I will give you the One Ring.

11
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,677
You offer it to me freely.

12
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,192
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

13
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:24,831
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

14
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:29,103
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

15
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:32,767
Treacherous as the sea!

16
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,215
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

17
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,016
All shall love me...

18
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:44,085
...and despair.

19
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,503
I pass the test. I will diminish...

20
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:05,242
...and go into the West...

21
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:09,880
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

22
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:17,648
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

23
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,046
...is to be alone.

24
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,258
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

25
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:28,056
And I am its keeper.

26
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,898
This task was appointed to you.

27
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,807
And if you do not find a way...

28
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,002
...no one will.

29
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:45,576
Then I know what I must do.

30
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,444
It's just...

31
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,952
...I'm afraid to do it.

32
00:03:56,461 --> 00:04:01,592
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

33
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:12,672
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

34
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,777
They were Elves once.

35
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,282
Taken by the Dark Powers...

36
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:24,649
...tortured and mutilated.

37
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:30,291
A ruined and terrible form of life.

38
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,426
And now...

39
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,730
...perfected.

40
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,630
My fighting Uruk-hai...

41
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,904
...whom do you serve?

42
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,566
Saruman!

43
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:10,866
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

44
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,004
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

45
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:17,174
You will taste Man-flesh!

46
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,910
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

47
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:30,282
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

48
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,387
Kill the others.

49
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:58,038
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

50
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,883
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

51
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,721
Lembas.

52
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:13,555
Elvish waybread.

53
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:19,059
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

54
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:27,511
How many did you eat?

55
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,339
Four.

56
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,747
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

57
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:42,052
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

58
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:44,717
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

59
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:48,763
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

60
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:54,030
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

61
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:11,313
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the FallIs of Rauros.

62
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,440
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

63
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:37,103
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

64
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:44,954
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

65
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:49,115
They have already seen service in war.

66
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:51,591
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

67
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:55,061
You will find your courage.

68
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,925
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

69
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,628
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

70
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:04,100
Thank you, my lady.

71
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,276
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

72
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:18,712
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

73
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,017
Nothing.

74
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,992
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

75
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,829
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

76
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,467
Actually....

77
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,271
There was one thing.

78
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,741
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

79
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,714
Stupid to ask.

80
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,381
I have nothing greater to give...

81
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:56,151
...than the gift you already bear.

82
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,545
That choice is yet before her.

83
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,190
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

84
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:34,328
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

85
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:38,832
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

86
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,627
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

87
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,236
I give you the light of Eärendil...

88
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,403
...our most beloved star.

89
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:29,952
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

90
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:34,284
...when all other lights go out.

91
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:46,330
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

92
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:51,271
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

93
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,342
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

94
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,547
What was her gift?

95
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:02,652
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

96
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:06,322
She gave me three.

97
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:51,928
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

98
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,760
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

99
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:02,166
But he's too clever a waterman.

100
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:06,306
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

101
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,707
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

102
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,972
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

103
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:14,208
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.

104
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,512
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

105
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,447
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm all right.

106
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:22,852
But you're not.

107
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,651
I'm here to help you.

108
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,524
I promised Gandalf that I would.

109
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:36,234
You can't help me, Sam.

110
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,138
Not this time.

111
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,140
Get some sleep.

112
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:53,550
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

113
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:56,855
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

114
00:13:57,528 --> 00:13:59,758
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

115
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,897
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

116
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,358
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

117
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:10,071
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

118
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:13,233
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

119
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,743
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

120
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,176
But you will not see that.

121
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,915
You are afraid!

122
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,745
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

123
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:27,479
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

124
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:34,262
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

125
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,441
Frodo.

126
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:50,803
The Argonath.

127
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:58,016
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

128
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,656
My kin.

129
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:21,898
We cross the lake at nightfall.

130
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,699
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

131
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:28,366
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

132
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:32,546
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

133
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:35,981
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

134
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:39,246
And after that, it gets even better.

135
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,593
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

136
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:46,195
That is our road.

137
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:50,894
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

138
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,864
Recover my--

139
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,841
-We should leave now.
-No.

140
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:02,444
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

141
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,137
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

142
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,343
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

143
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:15,052
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

144
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:21,964
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

145
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,195
Where's Frodo?

146
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,761
None of us should wander alone.

147
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,257
You, least of all.

148
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:57,934
So much depends on you.

149
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,937
Frodo?

150
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,605
I know why you seek solitude.

151
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:14,751
You suffer. I see it day by day.

152
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,613
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

153
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:22,919
There are other ways, Frodo.

154
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:26,960
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

155
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:30,964
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

156
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:34,262
Warning? Against what?

157
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,598
We're all afraid, Frodo.

158
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:40,436
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

159
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:44,444
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

160
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:49,516
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

161
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:53,146
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

162
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:58,054
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

163
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:03,196
What chance do you think you have?

164
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,064
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

165
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:12,002
And you will beg for death
before the end!

166
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:16,203
You fool!

167
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:20,406
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

168
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:23,417
It should be mine! Give it to me!

169
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:24,884
-Give it to me!
-No!

170
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,886
-Give it to me!
-No.

171
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,556
I see your mind.

172
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,735
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

173
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:41,837
You will betray us!

174
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,236
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

175
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:49,339
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

176
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:57,910
Frodo?

177
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:03,817
Frodo.

178
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:09,756
What have I done?

179
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,696
Please, Frodo.

180
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,564
Frodo, I'm sorry!

181
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,586
Frodo?

182
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,916
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

183
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:10,923
Stay away!

184
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:12,920
Frodo!

185
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:18,999
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

186
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,170
Would you destroy it?

187
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:38,121
Aragorn.

188
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:43,857
Aragorn.

189
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:47,527
Elessar.

190
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:58,539
I would have gone with you to the end.

191
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:02,042
Into the very fires of Mordor.

192
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:06,542
I know.

193
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:14,480
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

194
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,957
Go, Frodo!

195
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,456
Run.

196
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,362
Run!

197
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:52,588
Mr. Frodo!

198
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:03,635
Find the halfling!

199
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:07,800
Find the halfling!

200
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:12,942
Elendil!

201
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,014
Aragorn, go!

202
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:44,043
Frodo!

203
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:46,241
Hide here. Quick!

204
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,317
Come on!

205
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:52,812
What's he doing?

206
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,051
He's leaving.

207
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,769
-No!
-Pippin!

208
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:14,007
Run, Frodo. Go on!

209
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,672
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

210
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,673
-Over here!
-This way!

211
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,859
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

212
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:31,278
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

213
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:15,489
Run!

214
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,702
No.

215
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:55,675
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

216
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,977
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

217
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:01,323
I let Frodo go.

218
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:04,619
Then you did what I could not.

219
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:08,927
I tried to take the Ring from him.

220
00:30:09,465 --> 00:30:13,697
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

221
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,201
I did not see it.

222
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,636
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

223
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:22,568
You fought bravely.

224
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:25,541
You have kept your honor.

225
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:28,047
Leave it.

226
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:30,477
It is over.

227
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:36,887
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

228
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,352
...and my city to ruin.

229
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,164
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

230
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:51,330
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

231
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:54,833
...nor our people fail.

232
00:30:55,778 --> 00:30:57,177
Our people.

233
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:03,076
Our people.

234
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:27,866
I would have followed you, my brother.

235
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:31,403
My captain.

236
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,950
My king.

237
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:57,835
Be at peace...

238
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:00,232
...son of Gondor.

239
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:20,060
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

240
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,555
But he will not return.

241
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:48,780
Frodo!

242
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:11,510
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

243
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:15,741
I wish none of this had happened.

244
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:21,519
So do all who live
to see such times...

245
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:25,183
...but that is not for them to decide.

246
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:27,989
All you have to decide...

247
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:32,930
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

248
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:03,857
Frodo, no!

249
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,697
Frodo!

250
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:09,165
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

251
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,676
Go back, Sam!

252
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,739
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

253
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:21,781
And I'm coming with you!

254
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:24,719
You can't swim!

255
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:30,220
Sam!

256
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,129
Sam!

257
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,770
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

258
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,444
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

259
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:29,177
And I don't mean to.

260
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:31,613
I don't mean to.

261
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,120
Sam.

262
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:51,667
Come on.

263
00:36:20,102 --> 00:36:24,664
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

264
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:44,549
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

265
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:52,867
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

266
00:37:04,714 --> 00:37:07,877
Not if we hold true to each other.

267
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:13,711
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

268
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:19,957
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

269
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:23,288
We travel light.

270
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:25,400
Let us hunt some Orc.

271
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,396
Yes!

272
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,825
Mordor.

273
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,827
I hope the others find a safer road.

274
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:58,325
Strider will look after them.

275
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:02,635
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

276
00:38:02,972 --> 00:38:05,406
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

277
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:07,166
We may.

278
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:10,303
Sam...

279
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,510
...I'm glad you are with me.

280
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,865
Timing by Khuno

281
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:56,736
